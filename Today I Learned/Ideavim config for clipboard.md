How to manage clipboard and buffer with `ideavim`

### Buffer
- [x] Yank
- [x] Paste fron buffer


### Clipboard
- [x] Copy to clipboard
- [x] Paste from clipboard

### Not doing anything
- [x] Delete without yank



Solved. Just misunderstanding
I map all the key related to clipboard with `leader` + `c`
with prefix `c` (clipboard)
